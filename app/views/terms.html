    <div class="section-body xb-inner-section" flex>
      <p>Please read these Terms of Service (“Agreement” or “Terms”) carefully before using the services offered by
        Xberts, Inc. This Agreement sets forth the legally binding terms and conditions for your use of the various websites
        owned and operated by Xberts, including, without limitation, the xberts.com website and domain name (“Sites”), the
        mobile application offered by Xberts (the “App”), your trial or your purchase of the products sold through our Sites
        and App (the “Products”), but not your use of such Products, and any other features, content, or applications offered
        from time to time by Xberts in connection with the above (collectively, the “Service”). By using the Service in
        any manner, whether by purchasing any Products, trying any Products for free, or just visiting or browsing the Sites
        and/or App, you agree to be bound by this Agreement.</p>

      <p class="xb-bold">ARBITRATION NOTICE: UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE YOU FIRST AGREE
        TO THESE TERMS BY FOLLOWING THE OPT-OUT PROCEDURE SPECIFIED IN THE “ARBITRATION” SECTION BELOW, AND EXCEPT FOR
        CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN THE “ARBITRATION” SECTION BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND
        XBERTS WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR
        TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>

      <p class="xb-bold">Acceptance of Terms </p>

      <p>By using our Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by these Terms, do not
        use the Service. If you are accessing and using the Service on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other
        legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to
        these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that company or other legal entity.
      </p>

      <p class="xb-bold">Modification of Terms of Service</p>

      <p>We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Sites or through other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them because if you continue to use the Service after we have posted modified Terms on the Sites, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the Service anymore. Because our Service is evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Service, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.</p>

      <p class="xb-bold"> Privacy 
      </p>

      <p>Please review our privacy practices to understand what information we collect and how we use it. Our privacy policy is located at <span class="text-underline">https://www.xberts.com/privacy</span> (the “Privacy Policy”) and is incorporated into these Terms. You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Service is subject to our Privacy Policy.r</p>

      <p class="xb-bold">Registration </p>

      <p>The Products and Service are available only to individuals who are at least 18 years old and capable of forming a binding contract with us. If you want to use certain features of the Service, such as purchasing our Products, you’ll have to create an account (<span class="xb-bold">“Account”</span>). You can do this via our Sites or through your account with certain third- party social networking services such as Facebook or Linkedin (each, an <span class="xb-bold">“SNS Account”</span>). If you choose the SNS Account option we’ll create your Account by extracting from your SNS Account certain personal information such as your name and email address and other personal information that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access.
      </p>

      <p>It’s important that you provide us with accurate, complete and up-to-date information for your Account and you agree to update such information, as needed, to keep it accurate, complete and up-to- date. If you don’t, we might have to suspend or terminate your Account. You agree that you won’t disclose your Account password to anyone and you’ll notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account. You’re responsible for all activities that occur under your Account, whether or not you know about them.</p>

      <p class="xb-bold">Offers </p>

      <p>You will find third party products, deals, advertisements and other offers on the Site (“Offers”). Offers are for products and services provided by third parties (each, a “Seller”), and if you choose to accept an Offer, the transaction will be between you and the Seller.</p>

      <p>Xberts has affiliate relationships with certain Sellers, and may receive compensation for your purchase from these Sellers. Xberts is not a party to, or in any way responsible for, your transaction with a Seller, including when we have an affiliate relationship with Seller. We are not responsible fulfilling any Offers.</p>

      <p>Xberts may allow you to accept Offers or make other purchases from Sellers on our Site, using our checkout tools. While our platform helps facilitate your purchase, the transaction is solely between you and the Seller. You will need to contact the Seller directly for customer service issues, including questions about the products or services for sale, order status inquiries and refund requests. Xberts does not provide any warranties or other protections for your purchase.</p>

      <p>Before you purchase a product or service or otherwise accept an Offer, please read the entire description of the Offer, including the fine print and any additional terms and conditions set forth on the Seller’s website. You are responsible for understanding what you are buying and for following the Seller’s instructions. The terms and conditions of Offers, including refund and cancellation policies, are governed by the Seller’s policies, not ours.  Please contact the Seller directly for questions regarding the Offer or your transaction with Seller.</p>

      <p class="xb-bold">Your Content </p>

      <p>You may post content, including photos, comments, links, and other materials on the Site, including Offers. Anything that you post or otherwise make available on the Site is referred to as “User Content.”  When you post User Content, you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to do so, including but not limited to having sufficient intellectual property rights in the User Content, and that to the best of your knowledge, the User Content complies with all applicable laws.</p>

Nothing in these Terms shall restrict other legal rights Xberts may have to User Content.  We are not obligated to review or monitor User Content but we reserve the right to remove or modify User Content for any reason, including User Content that we believe violates these Terms or our policies.</p>

      <p>We do not guarantee how quickly your User Content will appear on the Site or how and where it will appear. We reserve the exclusive right to describe, categorize and place Offers in our sole discretion.</p>

      <p>Following termination or deactivation of your account, we will retain and use your account information and any User Content in accord with these Terms and our Privacy Policy (found at https://www.Xberts.com/privacy).</p>

      <p>We value hearing from you, and are always interested in learning about ways we can improve the Site. If you choose to submit comments, ideas or feedback, you agree that we may use them without restriction and without any compensation, attribution or accounting to you.</p>

      <p class="xb-bold">Dispute Resolution</p>

      <p class="text-underline">Governing Law</p>

      <p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</p>

      <p class="text-underline">Agreement to Arbitrate</p>

      <p>You and Xberts agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach,
        termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Service (collectively, <span class="xb-bold">“Disputes”</span>) will
        be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small
        claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent
        the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade
        secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an <span class="xb-bold">“IP
        Protection Action”</span>). Without limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to litigate any other
        Dispute if you provide Xberts with written notice of your desire to do so by email to support@xberts.com within
        thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms (such notice, an <span class="xb-bold">“Arbitration Opt-out Notice”</span>).
        If you don’t provide Xberts with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed
        to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in
        clauses (i) and (ii) above. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely
        provide Xberts with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern
        District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
        Unless you timely provide Xberts with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, <span class="xb-bold">you acknowledge and agree that you and Xberts
        are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class
        action or representative proceeding. </span>Further, unless both you and Xberts otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator
        may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or
        representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute
        Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution”
        section will survive any termination of these Terms.
      </p>

      <p class="text-underline">Arbitration Rules</p>

      <p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (<span class="xb-bold">“AAA”</span>) in accordance with the Commercial
        Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the <span class="xb-bold">“AAA Rules”</span>) then in effect,
        except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at <span class="text-underline">www.adr.org/arb_med</span> or
        by calling the AAA at 1-800- 778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement
        of this Section.

      <p class="text-underline">Arbitration Process</p>

      <p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration
        as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a general <span class="text-underline">Demand for Arbitration</span> and a separate 
        <span class="text-underline">Demand for Arbitration for California residents</span>.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed
        to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
      </p>

      <p class="text-underline">Arbitration Location and Procedure</p>

      <p>Unless you and Xberts otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Xberts submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>

      <p class="text-underline">Arbitrator’s Decision</p>

      <p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Xberts will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>

      <p class="text-underline">Fees</p>

      <p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Xberts will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>

      <p class="text-underline">Changes</p>

      <p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification of Terms” section above, if Xberts changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to www.Xberts.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of Xberts’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Xberts in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>

      <p class="xb-bold">
        General Terms
      </p>

      <p>These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Xberts and you regarding the Service (including Products), and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Xberts and you regarding the Service (including Products). If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable (either by an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the terms of the “Arbitration” section above or by court of competent jurisdiction, but only if you timely opt out of arbitration by sending us an Arbitration Opt-out Notice in accordance with the terms set forth above), that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Xberts’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. Xberts may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>

      <p>Any notices or other communications provided by Xberts under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Service. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p>

      <p>Xberts’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Xberts. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</p>
